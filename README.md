# video-concat
Simple Script to concatenate multiple video files together

## Description
This is a very simple script that will use ffmpeg to concatenate multiple video files together into one file.   You must have ffmpeg installed and it must be accessible in the path to do this.

There isn't alot of error checking.   It will take three arguments:

video-concat {file1} {file2} {output}

The script will then concatenate the file1 and file2 and store the final version in output
